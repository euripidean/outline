# Welcome to Outline

Outline is a project I designed and built as part of my Applied Computer Science course at Dominican University of California.
It's an interactive narrative planning board for writers - an online version of 3 by 5 index cards, with a few extra features.

## Tech Stack

_Frontend_

- React
- Redux
- RTK Query
- Dnd-Kit
- TailwindCSS

_Backend_

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete cards and projects
- Drag and drop cards within your project to reorder them
- Create multiple projects and manage them from the dashboard
- View and edit your cards in a modal

## Future Features

- User authentication
- Sharing projects with other users
- Exporting plans to a document
- More robust search and filter options
- Set narrative structure and track progress
- I'd love to integrate this functionality into Highland 2, a writing app I use frequently.

## Design

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

### `cd server $ node server.js`

To get the server running, navigate to the server directory and run `node server.js`
